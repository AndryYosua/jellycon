<h3>A Little History</h3>

<p>The current Emby for Kodi addon has had a number of iterations over the years, it goes back a long way, all the way back to XBMB3C which was based on a Plex addon from that era.</p>

<p>One Year anniversary (10/24/2014):</p>

</br></br>

<p>So that gives it a starting date of around October 2013. The release post form @xnappo:</p>

</br></br>

<p>And the first initial commit to the original XBMB3C:</p>

<a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.Kodi/commit/6e3b8b0525d065c8359cf4c986161de12551f3f7">https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.Kodi/commit/6e3b8b0525d065c8359cf4c986161de12551f3f7</a>
</br></br>

<p>Over time we switch from using the server interaction for each directory view to using the built in Kodi DB and a sync method to keep the Emby and Kodi DBs in sync. We also changed the name from XBMB3C to Emby for Kodi.</p>

<p>All in all the addon is so much better than it was back then, it has a lot of features and the integration with the Kodi DB makes it fast. There have been some outstanding devs on the project over this time and the quality and quantity of work they have been able to achieve is very impressive. What has impressed me the most is the collaboration here on the forum the team has kept up.</p>

<p>The only draw back for me that has cropped up is perhaps the complexity and for lack of a better word, weight of the addon. With each new feature that was added more code, more complexity and more weight was added. In this case the initial sync of data I am considering as weight, time spent on setting up and configuration.</p>

<p>Yes the addon is great and I use it on a daily basis, it works and works very well. However I want options.</p>

<p>I want a light weight addon with a cut back feature set, simple setup and simple install. I dont want it to take over the Kodi DB and I want it to just work to play back my collection. I would also love it to be in the official Kodi repo.</p>

<p>With all of this in mind a went back to a project I had on the go a few years back, it was using an early cut of the original XBMB3C addon way back from the day it was just a simple display and playback addon.
In September 2014 I cut a new addon from the even then old source of the addon we had at that time. This was a simple addon with a simple goal, display media items from Emby and allow a user to play them back.</p>

<p>I have now update that addon and renamed it to EmbyCon, it uses the old server client approach to display media items you have on your Emby server and allows you to play them back.</p>
