<h3>What is EmbyCon?</h3>

<p>EmbyCon is an addon for Kodi that allows you to browse and play back your Movie, TV Shows and Music from your Emby media server using Kodi.</p>

<p>For more information on Emby check out the official <a href="https://emby.media/"><strong>Emby Media Server</strong></a> site.</p>

<h3>Installing EmbyCon</h3>
 
<p>You can install the EmbyCon Addon from the official Kodi addon repository.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open Kodi</li>
<li>Select Add-on from the main menu</li>
<li>Select "Download" at the bottom of the Add-on menu</li>
<li>Select "Video add-ons"</li>

<h3>Home Screen Integration</h3>
 
<p>Due to the fact this addon does not populate the built in Kodi database none of the built in home screen widgets work by default. This is because Kodi does not know about your content.</p>
 
<p>There are a few ways to fix this, one way is to use a Kodi Skin that allows you to set up custom menu items. Another way is to edit the skin home screen file directly.</p>

<p>There are examples of both of these approaches in the menu on the left.</p>
